# Task: Create Go Advanced Patterns Theory

## Your Mission
Explain idiomatic Go patterns vs C++ design patterns - how Go features change design.

## What to Create
Theory on:
- Functional options pattern (elegant API design)
- Context package (cancellation, deadlines, request-scoped values)
- Worker pool pattern (goroutine management)
- Pipeline patterns (channel composition)
- Middleware pattern (HTTP handlers, function wrapping)
- Singleton in Go (sync.Once)
- Factory pattern with interfaces
- Adapter pattern (implicit interface satisfaction)
- Decorator pattern with composition
- Error handling patterns (wrap, sentinel errors, error types)
- Concurrency patterns (semaphores, barriers, rate limiting)
- Fan-out/fan-in patterns
- Timeout and cancellation patterns
- Graceful shutdown patterns

## Design Patterns Evolution
- How Go's features enable different patterns than GoF
- Comparison with C++ Gang of Four patterns
- How interfaces change design approach
- How goroutines and channels enable new patterns
- Idiomatic Go patterns that don't exist in C++
- Patterns from C++ that don't work in Go
