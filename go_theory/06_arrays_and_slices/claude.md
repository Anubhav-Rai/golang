# Topic 06: Arrays and Slices

## Context
Most important Go data structure - slices (NOT like C++ vectors!).

## Structure
- `basic/` - Arrays, slice basics, append
- `intermediate/` - Slice internals, capacity, copy
- `advanced/` - Memory layout, performance, tricks

## Key Focus
- Arrays are values (copy on assign!)
- Slices are references
- append, len, cap
- Slice internals: pointer + len + cap
