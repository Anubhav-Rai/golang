# Topic 03: Operators and Expressions

## Context  
Go operators - differences from C++, no ternary, ++ is statement.

## Structure
- `basic/` - Arithmetic, comparison, logical operators
- `intermediate/` - Bitwise, address operators, no ternary
- `advanced/` - Operator precedence, special cases

## Key Focus
- ++ and -- are statements only
- No ternary operator (?:)
- No pointer arithmetic
- Bit clear operator (&^)
