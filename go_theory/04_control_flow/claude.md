# Task: Create Go Control Flow Theory

## Your Mission
Explain how Go simplified and improved control structures vs C/C++.

## What to Create
Theory covering:
- If without parentheses (cleaner syntax - why remove them?)
- If with initialization (scoping benefit)
- For as ONLY loop construct (no while, no do-while - radical choice)
- Range-based for (vs C++11 range-for)
- Switch improvements: no fallthrough by default, any expression in cases
- Type switch (unique Go feature)
- Defer (vs RAII, finally)
- Break, continue, goto, labels
- NO ternary operator (forces clarity)

## Design Philosophy to Explore
- Why only one loop type? (Simplicity philosophy)
- Why no automatic fallthrough in switch? (Common C bug)
- How does defer compare to RAII?
- What does simplicity cost vs gain?

## Structure
Theory.md files in subfolders with comparative examples.
