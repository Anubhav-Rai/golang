# Task: Create Go Basics and Syntax Theory

## Your Mission
Create comprehensive theory files for Go basics and syntax, targeting a C/C++ developer who wants to understand both Go AND language design principles.

## What to Create
Create subfolders (basic/, intermediate/, advanced/) with ONE `theory.md` file in each that contains:
- Detailed explanations comparing Go to C/C++
- WHY Go made different design choices (design philosophy)
- Code examples inline with explanations
- Deep dive into language design rationale

## Topics to Cover
- Package system (vs C/C++ headers, #include)
- Entry point: main() function and package main
- Variable declarations (var, :=, type inference vs C++)
- Type system philosophy (explicit vs implicit)
- Constants and iota
- Zero values (safety vs C/C++ uninitialized)
- Comments and documentation conventions
- gofmt and enforced formatting (why?)
- Code organization philosophy

## Requirements
- Be EXTREMELY detailed and theoretical
- Always compare with C/C++
- Explain the "WHY" behind every design choice
- Examples embedded in same file as theory
- Help learner understand language design tradeoffs
- If a level (basic/intermediate/advanced) isn't needed, skip it

## Style
Theoretical, comparative, design-focused. Think like a language designer explaining choices.
