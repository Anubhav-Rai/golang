# Topic 13: Concurrency

## Context
Goroutines - lightweight threads, Go's superpower.

## Structure
- `basic/` - Goroutines basics, WaitGroup
- `intermediate/` - Mutex, RWMutex, sync primitives
- `advanced/` - Race detector, atomic, context

## Key Focus
- go keyword creates goroutine
- Much lighter than threads
- WaitGroup for synchronization
- Mutex for shared state
