# Topic 07: Maps

## Context
Built-in hash maps - like C++ unordered_map but simpler.

## Structure
- `basic/` - Creating, accessing, deleting
- `intermediate/` - Comma-ok idiom, iteration, maps as sets

## Key Focus
- Built-in hash maps
- No ordered iteration
- Comma-ok for existence check
- Zero value is nil (can't use!)
