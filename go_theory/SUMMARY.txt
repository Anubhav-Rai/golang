KEY FEATURES:
-------------
• Each topic has C/C++ comparisons throughout
• claude.md files designed for AI-assisted learning
• Organized by difficulty: basic → intermediate → advanced
• Context-aware: Can work on any topic independently
• Comprehensive: From "Hello World" to production patterns
• Practical: Focus on real-world usage and common pitfalls

HOW TO START:
-------------
1. Read README.md first
2. Start with 01_basics_and_syntax/claude.md
3. Create your own examples in basic/ folders
4. Use QUICK_REFERENCE.md for quick syntax lookups
5. Use INDEX.md to navigate topics

RECOMMENDED TIMELINE:
--------------------
• Week 1-2: Topics 1-5 (Fundamentals)
• Week 3-4: Topics 6-10 (Core Concepts)
• Week 5-6: Topics 11-15 (Go Idioms)
• Week 7-8: Topics 16-20 (Professional Skills)

QUICK REFERENCE FILES:
----------------------
README.md           - Complete learning guide
INDEX.md            - Topic-by-topic breakdown
QUICK_REFERENCE.md  - Syntax comparison cheat sheet
SUMMARY.txt         - This overview

EACH TOPIC CONTAINS:
--------------------
claude.md      - Full learning context with:
                 • C/C++ comparisons
                 • Key differences
                 • Learning path (basic/intermediate/advanced)
                 • Common pitfalls
                 • Best practices
                 • Practice focus areas

basic/         - Create your beginner examples here
intermediate/  - Create your intermediate examples here
advanced/      - Create your advanced examples here

WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL:
-------------------------
✓ Designed specifically for C/C++ developers
✓ Every concept compared with familiar C++ syntax
✓ Highlights key differences upfront
✓ Context-optimized for AI assistant (Claude) usage
✓ No context limits - each topic is self-contained
✓ Progressive difficulty in each topic
✓ Production-ready patterns included
✓ Real-world focus, not just syntax

LEARNING PHILOSOPHY:
--------------------
Go is NOT C++ with different syntax!
• Embrace simplicity over complexity
• Composition over inheritance
• Explicit over implicit
• Concurrency as first-class feature
• Errors as values, not exceptions
• "Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating"

START HERE:
-----------
$ cd 01_basics_and_syntax
$ cat claude.md

Then create hello.go in basic/ folder and start coding!

USEFUL COMMANDS:
----------------
go run main.go          - Run program
go build               - Build executable
go test ./...          - Run all tests
go fmt ./...           - Format all code
go mod init <name>     - Initialize module
go get <package>       - Get dependency

Happy learning! 🚀
