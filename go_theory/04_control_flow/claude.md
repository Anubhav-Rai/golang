# Topic 04: Control Flow

## Context
Go control structures - simpler than C++, defer is unique.

## Structure
- `basic/` - if, for, switch basics
- `intermediate/` - Range loops, labeled breaks, defer
- `advanced/` - Defer order, panic/recover, complex control

## Key Focus
- No parentheses in if/for
- Only 'for' loop (no while!)
- Switch without fallthrough
- defer keyword (like RAII)
