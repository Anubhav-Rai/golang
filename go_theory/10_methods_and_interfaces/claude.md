# Methods and Interfaces - Working Context

This directory contains comprehensive Go learning materials for **Methods and Interfaces**.

## Structure

- `basic/` - Fundamental concepts with C/C++ comparisons
- `intermediate/` - Advanced usage and design patterns
- `advanced/` - Deep dives and optimizations

## Learning Approach

Start with `basic/theory.md` which explains:
- Core Go concepts
- How they differ from C/C++
- Why Go made these design choices
- Practical examples throughout

Progress to intermediate and advanced as you master basics.

## Key Focus

Understanding **why** Go chose each design, not just **what** it is.
Every feature is explained in comparison to C/C++ with design rationale.
