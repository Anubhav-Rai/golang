# Task: Create Go Structs Theory

## Your Mission
Explain Go's radical departure from C++ OOP - no classes, no inheritance.

## What to Create
Theory on:
- Structs vs C structs (similar)
- Structs vs C++ classes (NO inheritance!)
- NO constructors/destructors (why not?)
- Embedding vs inheritance (composition over inheritance)
- Anonymous fields and field promotion
- Exported/unexported via capitalization (convention IS syntax)
- Struct tags (for reflection - metaprogramming)
- Zero values of structs (safety)
- Struct literals and initialization patterns
- NO operator overloading
- Value vs pointer receivers (preview for methods)

## Revolutionary Design Discussion
- Why NO inheritance? (Simplicity, no fragile base class problem)
- How embedding provides flexibility inheritance doesn't
- Go's OOP philosophy vs C++ (composition vs hierarchy)
- What problems from C++ does this solve?
- What patterns from C++ don't work in Go?

## Structure
Theory.md showing composition patterns vs inheritance.
